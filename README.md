## How to use this Bleeding Branch 🩸 📖

**You can use this unstable, semi-constantly updating version of the theme by doing either of the following:**

#### Powercord
* Open a terminal in the themes folder and type `git clone -b dev https://github.com/SlippingGitty/SlideToUnlock.git`

#### BetterDiscord
* Locate **SlidetoUnlock.theme.css**, and open it in your prefered text editor
* Find `@import url("");`, and replace the URL with `https://slippinggitty.github.io/SlidetoUnlockBleeding.css`

I would very much prefer you use this if you'd like to help out, but hey, do as you please. c:
